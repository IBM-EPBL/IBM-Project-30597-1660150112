Chapter 1 : 

Introduction to JAVA. 
Just read the chapter to understand the basic concepts of JAVA. 

Concentrate on The Java Buzzwords

Chapter 2: 

This is where it actually starts.

If you are a student, then i would suggest you to use only Notepad/Sublime Text/Atom text editors to write your code and compile them using command line. 

If you are already working and you are just going to brush up your Java knowledge, you can use any IDEs of your choice. 

There are only 2-3 programs in this chapter
1. Simple Hello World
2. Using loops
3. Using if-else 

Max Time (1 day)

You can take as much time as you want. But if you are able to complete within this time, you will have time to discuss and clarify your doubts with others. 


Every time we complete a chapter, we will a day or two break for discussing stuff related to the chapter depending on the chapter's depth.



Problems to try

Do not google the solution for this. Just  think and try. If you are not able to get the logic right, message in the group for help. Don't GOOGLE.

Problems to try


Do not google the solution for this. Just  think and try. If you are not able to get the logic right, message in the group for help. Don't GOOGLE.

4. Print Hello World in the following pattern in a single system.out.println

e    l    "l"o
W o r l d


5. Try the type casting problems in the book

6. Print the characters stored in the array value [96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103]

7. Print the characters stored in the array value [[96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103],[96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103],[96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103],[96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103]]

8. Create a calculator program to perform addition / subtraction / multiplication / division of two numbers

9. Find Bitwise AND OR NOT XOR 

    let a = "1000"
    let b = "1010"

    find:  NOT(a) AND b OR a XOR b

10. Left shift "0001" 3 times and Right shift "1000" 3 times

Chapter 5 : Control Statements

This week we are just going to concentrate on control statements

Selection statements:
    if
    if else
    if else if & else
    switch 

Iteration statements:
    while
    do while
    for


Problems:

1. Print the following  using for, while and do while

*****
****
***
**
*


   *  
  * * 
 * * *
 ** **
 *****


2. Print the following using loops and if / if else 

  1  
3 3 
5 5 5
77 77
99999
88 88
6 6 6
 4 4 
  2  


3. Create a calculator app when when give input like 
5 + 3
2 - 1
6 * 3
9 / 3
etc
should do the operation and find the result
Use switch for different operations +,-,*,/,%





Chapter 6 : Classes

This week we are just going to concentrate on classes. 

Understand the following concepts.
    1. Class
    2. Object
    3. Methods
    4. Constructor
    5. this 



Problems:

1. Create the following classes
    Circle
    Square
    Rectangle

    Area
    Circumference

    Main


    Circle should have radius as an instance variable
    Square should have side as an instance variable
    Rectangle should have length and height as instance variable

    Area should have a method to calculate the area of circle, square, and rectangle
    Circumference should have a method to calculate the circumference of circle, square and rectangle

    Main 
    Main method :
        Should create objects for both Area and Circumference classes and print the area and circumference of circle, square and rectangle

2. Create a Pet class with name, age and type variables. Create methods to set and get the variables.
    Create a main class and create an array of 10 objects of Pet class with some name, age and type.
    Iterate the array and print the details of each object.

    The output should be like,

    Name: X Age: 1 Type: Dog
    Name: Y Age: 2 Type: Cat
    ..
    ..
    ..
    Name: Z Age: 2 Type: Cat

    for all objects in the array. The variable values can be anything. 

Time: 5 days

This week should be pretty easy. Just basics of classes.


Chapter 7 : A Closer Look at Methods and Classes
We will split this chapter into two. 

This week also we are just going to concentrate on classes and its methods

Understand the following concepts.
    1. Overloading Methods
    2. Overloading constructors
    3. Passing objects as arguments
    4. Returning Objects
    5. Recursion 



Problems:

1. Create the following classes

    Area

    Main

    a. Area should have a overloaded method called findArea with different parameters for square and rectangle
    b. Area should have three constructors, 1- default and 2 - with one param (square) and 3 - with two param  (rectangle) and have a single method to calculate the area

    Main 
    Main method :
        Should create objects for Area classes and print the area of square and rectangle

2. Write a program to find factorial of a number using recursion

3. Write a program to calculate power of a number using recursion

4. Write a program to convert number to its binary using recursion

5. Write a program to convert binary number to its decimal value using recursion




Chapter 7 : A Closer Look at Methods and Classes
Part - 2

This week also we are just going to concentrate on understanding the following concepts.
    1. Access control
    2. static
    3. final
    4. nested classes
    5. Arguments passing



Problems:

1. Create the following classes

    Area

    Main

    a. Create a static block to initialize the values
    b. Create a static method to find the area 

    Main 
    Main method :
        Call Area's static method and print the area of square and rectangle

2. Create the following classes

    Animal Class
        - Dog class
        - Cat class
        - Mouse class

    Animal class being the class and Dog, Cat and Mouse are nested classes inside the Animal class

    Create object for Animal class which should inturn create objects for Dog, Cat, Mouse inside the constructor.

    Add a print method to Animal class which will call print method inside the Dog, Cat, Mouse classes and print the name of the pets

3. Create a Main class and create a final String variable and have a string value initialized
    eg. final String mystring = "I am learning JAVA today! ";

    a. Create a method which takes a number as param and prints the character at that index in the string mystring
    b. Create a method which prints the length of the string
    c. Create a method which takes a string value as param and checks whether the string param and the string mystring are equal
    d. Create a method which takes a string value as param and checks whether the string param exists in string mystring
    e. Create a method which takes a char value as param and splits the string mystring into parts and print the parts




Chapter 8 : Inheritance 

Understand the following concepts.
    1. Inheritance
    2. super()
    3. method overriding
    4. abstract class
    5. final for methods



Problems:

1. Create the following classes

    Animal

    Dog
    Cat
    Camel



    a. Animal class should have a constructor with variables name, age, and gender, and methods for setting and getting these variables
    b. Dog and Cat class should have the variable petname and methods for getting and setting the petname variable
    c. Dog, Cat, and Camel class should inherit the Animal class
    d. Camel class should override gender method of Animal class and print "Cannot be disclosed"
    e. Dog and Cat class should have a constructor which calls the Animal class constructor using super.
    f. Create an object of Dog class and assing it to Animal class and print the name age and gender
    g. Create an abstract method in Animal class called isEndangered and override the method in all child classes
    h. Add final keyword to getter method of name parameter, this will not allow you to override the method



    


Chapter 9 : Packages and Interfaces 

Understand the following concepts.
    1. Packages
    2. Interfaces



Problems:

    1. Make the each chapter's questions as a package
    2. Create an interface which has a function called execute, which has to be extended for each chapter and will perform the functionality of main function in each chapter
    3. create objects for the extended interface class 
    4. Create a Github repo and push these code into the repo.
